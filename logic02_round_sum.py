----------------------------------------
For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if 
its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round 
down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 
12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded 
values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):" 
and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent 
level as round_sum().

round_sum(16, 17, 18) â†’ 60
round_sum(12, 13, 14) â†’ 30
round_sum(6, 4, 4) â†’ 10

def round_sum(a, b, c):
    return round10(a) + round10(b) + round10(c)

def round10(num):
    change = num % 10
    if change >= 5:
        return num + (10 - change)
    else:
        return num - change
